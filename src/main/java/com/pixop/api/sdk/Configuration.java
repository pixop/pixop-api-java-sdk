/*
 * Pixop API Documentation
 *  The Pixop API provides a comprehensive RESTful interface for interacting with the Pixop Platform. It allows users to manage API keys, projects, videos, and more.  The Pixop Platform offers video processing features such as upscaling, format conversion, and compression. It uses AI-driven algorithms to optimize video quality, reduce file sizes, and improve playback performance.  **Quick Start Guide** - Explore the [Pixop API Documentation](https://docs.pixop.com/reference/) to familiarize yourself with the API's capabilities.  **Required Headers** Include the following headers in all API requests: - `Accept`: `application/json` - `Content-Type`: `application/json` - `X-API-Key`: Your API key for authentication (e.g., `X-API-Key: <your-api-key>`).     **Note:** API key management endpoints that use Basic Authentication do not require the `X-API-Key` header.  **Rate Limits** All endpoints, except those related to API key management, enforce rate limits. Response headers provide the following rate limit details: - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests allowed per minute. - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window. - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The number of seconds until the current rate limit window resets.
